Well hello there and welcome to my humble Github profile... You won't find much here...

Mostly just the following:
 - Issues for projects that I actively use/follow
 - A few gists for verification
 - Some repos/forks I use for Discord servers I administrate/moderate
 - and maybe the occasional cringe issue that I cannot delete ~~existence is pain~~

I can easily be reached via Discord LividJava#8420 or [Keybase](https://keybase.io/lividjava)
